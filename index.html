             Armed with advanced technology, a handpicked team of intrepid explorers and scientists embark on a global odyssey to solve some of the ocean’s greatest mysteries through
            the lives of its animals and their ecosystems.The team travels to the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean to reveal the greatest secrets in the lives of the
            North Atlantic humpback whale: Why do thousands gather in one tiny patch of ocean every year, and what lengths do they go to in choosing a mate? While exploring the humpbacks’
             hidden world, they witness a mother defend her calf in the ultimate ocean battle with a pack of orcas.</p>

        to illuminate and protect the wonder of our world.Stories of Africa’s wildlife and natural heritage have long captivated audiences around the world, yet these stories have rarely been told by Africans. Filmmakers and National Geographic Explorers Noel Kok and Pragna Parsotam-Kok witnessed the lack of equity within the industry themselves and declared it was time to make a change.
        “One of the ways of trying to change human behavior is by trying to change the story,” says Noel. “If the same storytellers have been making the same story for so long, then maybe you need to change the storyteller.” 
        In 2017, they co-founded Nature, Environment and Wildlife Filmmakers (NEWF) which offers professional development, capacity building, mentorship, and networking opportunities to African filmmakers and storytellers. Over the years, they have built a community of emerging storytellers,
         called NEWF Fellows, who gain access to the tools and skills needed to succeed within the industry. The Fellows have the opportunity to participate in NEWF Labs that provide specialized training such as dive certification, cinematography, music composition, and science communication. </p>

She leans in and plunges beneath the shadowy surface, disappearing with her fellow divers into a bubbly abyss. They descend toward a hidden history etched into the sandy floor.
               Somewhere below, buried by the passage of time and the sea, lies a wreck — one of an estimated 1,000 ships carrying captive African people that wrecked before reaching shore between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Guerrero was a Spanish slave ship seized by the British Royal Navy in 1827. While illegally transporting 561 Africans to Cuba 
               (trading captive Africans between nations had been made illegal by Spain, England, and the Americas, though domestic trade of enslaved people continued), the vessel was chased by the British and crashed resulting in 41 deaths. Five hundred and twenty African people survived. The Guerrero was swallowed by the deep blue. </p>

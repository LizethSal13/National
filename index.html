        <h2><b>Oceanxplorers</b></h2>
        <p>In this series from James Cameron, go aboard the OceanXplorer—the most advanced research vessel ever built—to investigate the farthest frontiers of the world’s oceans.
             Armed with advanced technology, a handpicked team of intrepid explorers and scientists embark on a global odyssey to solve some of the ocean’s greatest mysteries through
              the lives of its animals and their ecosystems. </p>

            <h3><b>Stories of Impact</b></h3>
            <p>National Geographic Explorer in Residence Tara Roberts peers into the depths of the Atlantic from the boat’s edge, hovering around the open water of the Florida Keys. She leans in and plunges beneath the shadowy surface, disappearing with her fellow divers into a bubbly abyss. They descend toward a hidden history etched into the sandy floor.
               Somewhere below, buried by the passage of time and the sea, lies a wreck — one of an estimated 1,000 ships carrying captive African people that wrecked before reaching shore between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Guerrero was a Spanish slave ship seized by the British Royal Navy in 1827. While illegally transporting 561 Africans to Cuba (trading captive Africans between nations had been made illegal by Spain, England, and the Americas, though domestic trade of enslaved people continued), the vessel was chased by the British and crashed resulting in 41 deaths. Five hundred and twenty African people survived. The Guerrero was swallowed by the deep blue. </p>
